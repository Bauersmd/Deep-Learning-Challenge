# Deep-Learning-Challenge
Module 21 Challenge

In this challenge we are given a CSV file from Alphabet Soup non-profit foundation. This CSV file contains over 34,000 organizations that recieved funding from Alphabet over the years. Alphabet Soup is a in the previous sentence a non-profit foundation. They want tools that help select applicants for funding based on the best chances for success in their ventures. 

In the CSV file contains a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization such as:
EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Given the columns above I narrowed it down by removing 2 columns called EIN and NAME

After typing my code and running my first file for Alphabet Soup Charity Optimization my accuracy that I achieved was 72%. From there I created another file and tried to get a higher accuracy than 72%

In my next file for coding I removed more columns to change things up and hope to get a better accuracy. The columns I removed other than EIN and NAME are: 'STATUS', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', 'ORGANIZATION'. The reason I chose these columns is because I felt that removing these columns would help me get a higher accuracy.

From there I added another node hidden layer to change my accuracy that could be higher.

After running my next three codes for a higher accuracy I was unable to change it.

Looking back at the data and code I can see that I can no longer get a higher accuracy than 72%. 

After completely each file of coding, I then saved then into an h5 file which is attached to the repository.

What I would recommend would either to add more node hidden layers or to just have one node hidden layer. I would also remove other columns than the ones that I chose or even certain data sets in columns.
